let : allows you to modify a variable with correct type-casting
declare : allows you to create a variable without initialization
export : allows us to modify an environmental variable (with immediate effect)
source : allows us to use functions as commands
backslash (\) : can be used to continue the command in the next line.
pipe (|) : takes the standard output of one process & passes it as standard input into another process
           hence, can only be used with functions that compute values
           (while keeping the concept of 'composability')
